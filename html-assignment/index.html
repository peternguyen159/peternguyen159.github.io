        <h2>About me</h2>
       <p> 
        My name is Peter Nguyen. I am a former student of Algonquin College.
        Last five years, I took Culinary Management and graduated 2 years after. 
        On my journeys, I also got some important milestones and certain achievements.
        However, I felt unhappy with my work routine, so I decided to change my
        career after a lot of research and self trials.

        Once I read and <em>Jim Rohn</em>, the author of the book said that 
         <blockquote>If you really want to do something, you'll find a way. If you don't, you'll find an excuse.</blockquote>
         After carefully considering, I had my first day back to school for the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD </abbr>program on May 6<sup>th</sup>,2024 . 
         I was so happy to be back, I can see my next 2 years will be very challenging but interesting.
