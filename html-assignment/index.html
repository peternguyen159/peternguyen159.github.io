        <h2>About me</h2>
       <p> 
        My name is Peter Nguyen. I am a former student of Algonquin College.
        In the last five years, I took Culinary Management and graduated 2 years later. 
        On my journeys, I also got some important milestones and certain achievements.
        However, I felt unhappy with my work routine, so I decided to change my
        career after a lot of research and self-trials.

        Once I read a book, <em>Jim Rohn</em>, the author of the book said that:
         <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/297774-if-you-really-want-to-do-something-you-ll-find-a">If you want to do something, you'll find a way. If you don't, you'll find an excuse.</blockquote>
         After carefully considering, I had my first day back to school for the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD </abbr>program on May 6<sup>th</sup>,2024. 
         I was so happy to be back, I can see my next 2 years will be challenging but interesting.
